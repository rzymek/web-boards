Features:
* svg pieces panel
* special counters: 1d6,2d6 roll counter
* counter overlays: mark used, target.  
  This means counters need to sometimes (always?) be wrapped in a `<g>`
* accounts
* initial setup (save state)

Bugs:
* global menu on another svg (unscaled) on desktop
* mousewheel not working on firefox
