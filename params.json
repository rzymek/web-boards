If you're interested please DO send\r\nme an email at eerzymek@gmail.com and I'll update this document.\r\n\r\n### Startup:\r\n\r\n1. load sprites.svg\r\n2. subscribe to Tables collection\r\n\r\n### On /play:tableId\r\n\r\n1. subscribe to Operations(tableId)\r\n2. find out what game this is: Tables.findOne(tableId).game\r\n3. render appropriate board: /games/{game}/images/{board.image}\r\n  1. attach sprites to board\r\n4. execute Operations (observe)\r\n5. check if user is in Table(tableId).players\r\n  1. if not, ask if what to join -> Meteor.call('join', tableId)\r\n\r\n### Counters\r\n\r\nCounters are represented by `SVGImageElement`.\r\n\r\n##### Properties:\r\n\r\n* `.position` - the hex (`SVGUseElement`) the counter is placed on\r\n\r\n##### TransformList\r\n`.transform` (`SVGTransformList`) items are in the follwing order:\r\n\r\n0. translation\r\n1. scale \r\n2. translation inside stack/stackSelector\r\n3. rotation \r\n\r\nAll are optional, but if present must be in this order and on these positions.\r\n\r\n### Hexes\r\n\r\nHexes are `SVGUseElement`-clones of a SVGPathElement. \r\nHexes are positioned using translation transformation. \r\nx=0,y=0 of a hex is in it's center.\r\n\r\n##### Properties:\r\n* `.stack` Array of counters (`SVGImageElement`) on the hex. May be `undefined` if empty.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
